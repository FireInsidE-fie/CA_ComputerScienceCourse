# Little Codey is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win
# championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the
# solar system.

# Write a space.py program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:

# Checks which number planet is equal to.
# It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.

# Here is the table of conversion:

#	Planet	RelativeGravity
# 1	Venus	0.91
# 2	Mars	0.38
# 3	Jupiter	2.34
# 4	Saturn	1.06
# 5	Uranus	0.92
# 6	Neptune	1.19

print("   1. Venus   2. Mars    3. Jupiter")
print("   4. Saturn  5. Uranus  6. Neptune\n")

weight = 185
